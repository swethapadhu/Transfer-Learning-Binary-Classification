### TRANSFER LEARNING - BINARY CLASSIFICATION MODEL (DOGS/CATS)

Built a binary image classifier for dog/cat images using Transfer Learning. 
The InceptionV3 model (trained on ImageNet) was used as the pre-trained network and the model was fine tuned for the desired cat/dog dataset. 
This model achieved an accuracy of 92%.
